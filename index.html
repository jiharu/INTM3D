# 3D Modelling & Animation INTM-2016-001
Fall 2017

**Course Code:** 3D Modelling & Animation 001    
**Meetings:** Tuesday 9:30~10:20  
**Location:** Room 650, Main Building / Sharp Centre (MCA)       
**Course webpage:** [http://jiharu.github.io/intm3d/](http://jiharu.github.io/intm3d/)       
**Class portfolio:** [http://2017intm3d.tumblr.com/](http://2017intm3d.tumblr.com/)   
**Office hours:** hji at faculty.ocadu.ca by appointment  

## Course description 

The 3D modeling & animation class is designed for students to learn both practical and theoretical knowledge in constructing and managing 3-dimensional modeling and animation art. It is a highly interdisciplinary and complex subject of artistic expression and technological understanding, therefore needing a creative open mindset from students. Throughout the class, there will be three projects to help students build problem-solving abilities toward the subject in an incremental way. 

Each class consists of one hour of lecture and two hours of lab practice to accomplish theoretical and practical approaches. The main software used in the class is Autodesk Maya, which has very strong support for modeling as well as other related stages of the production pipeline.

The level of the course covers beginner to intermediate. Evaluation will be mainly via three projects and minor assignments taking a creative approach to expressive 3D modeling, texturing, and animation.

## Course objectives

-  To build a framework of skills and vocabulary to create and modify 3D data.   
-  To understand the fundamental components and their position in the production pipeline of 3D modeling & animation art-making.   
-  To appreciate the interdisciplinary research attitudes of art and technology (via computer graphics).   
-  To invest independent and artistic expression along with problem solving processes during construction.   
-  To develop awareness of current 3D modeling & animation practices through diverse examples of animation, films, video games, virtual worlds, 3D printing, and so on.  

There will be three projects and several minor assignments. It is expected that the majority of the assignments will be completed outside of class time. 
		
### Students will learn

Understanding 3D computer graphics / Maya interface and structure / Maya NURBS, polygon, subdivision modeling / shading including texturing / UV texture mapping / deformers & shape blending / digital cinematography / lighting & rendering / global illumination / ambient occlusion shading & depth of field / key-frame animation / path animation / camera & lighting animation 

## Course format

This class is highly practice based. One-third of the class will be lecture-based, showing theory and practice using presentation media and demonstration (33%). The other two-thirds will be supervised students’ hands-on practice (66%). 

-  Please be patient to repeat practice exercises until you feel familiar with the logic & structure of the 3D software interface, pipeline, processes, and vocabularies, since complexities can easily overwhelm. If you have any question or difficulty in following, don’t hesitate to ask to the instructor.   
-  Develop your unique preference as a maker/producer among a variety of 3D modeling and animation techniques.   
-  If you have high fluency using 3D software, then investigate near future trends and develop your artistic style.   
-  When you research examples of 3D artworks, try to avoid popular mass productions such as Pixar’s or DreamWorks’; instead find a specific modeler and investigate his/her portfolio as an independent artist.   
-  Explore many usages of 3D modeling or animation in different areas such as entertainment, education, medical, manufacture, and so on.   
-  Sharing information is recommended to accelerate the speed of progress, unless it interrupts other students’ concentration. Students will share their assignments through the Tumblr website [http://2017intm3d.tumblr.com/](http://2017intm3d.tumblr.com/). Questions and discussions are encouraged during class time.   

### Supply
Students will be required to supply headphones in the class to follow web tutorials. Please also bring a notebook or small sketchbook and pencils to collect ideas.

## Grade breakdown
- Project 1- Modeling a scene (e.g., still life, room) (20%)  
- Project 2- Shading & rendering (20%)  
- Project 3- Addition & Completion with camera animation (30%)  	
- Assigments (20%) 
- Attendance & Participation (10%)  

### Project description:  
More details regarding projects and assignments will be announced in class. 

-	**Project 1- Modeling a scene:** Based on a chosen reference of a masterwork of still life (painting or a photograph) with a scene construction, reconstruct via 3D modeling. You can use a default lighting set-up without shadows. Submit a screenshot along with the reference image you have chosen (it can be by you or other artists), and an explanation of both as a pdf, to Canvas. Please consider that you might extend this scene for the following projects. (20%)  
-	**Project 2- Shading & rendering:** Continuation and completion of project 1 applying proper shaders with textures and cinematographic set-up including camera, lights, and shadows. Details will be announced in class. (20%)  
-	**Project 3- Addition & completion with camera animation:** 15 seconds completed animation, using a software renderer. More details will be announced in class. (30%)  
-	**Assignments:** simple hands-on practices designed to help students’ progress following each 3D modeling & animation subtopic. Completion in time and proper targeting to the subject are the two evaluation criteria. (20%) 

The evaluation will be based on cumulative achievement, regular attendance and the student’s participation in research, making, and creative expression. It is expected that students will show a commitment to completing all projects and assignments with creative & aesthetic solutions based consistent work habits both in class time and outside of class time. 

Exceptions to the lateness penalty for valid reasons such as illness, compassionate grounds, etc., will be considered with supporting documentation (e.g., a doctor's letter).

## Evaluation criteria
- Quality of the work produced; with the balance of the student’s artistic expression & sensitivity as well as technical understanding, with integration of techniques and subject.  
- Ability to solve problems into the process of making.  
- The progress and engagement of the student in their research, and their curiosity and motivation to learn and achieve.  
- The degree and details to which students can set challenges for her or himself.  
- Commitment (includes attendance, participation, completing work on time)    

When you submit your work, please name your assignment as the following format: **last name_first name_date_assignment number.extension**
