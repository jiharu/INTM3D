# Rendering

Rendering is the final step of the 3D animation pipeline and its quality is crucial to the strong completion of your project. Let's check out some more techniques which can make your final image distinguished.

## Render view

- Render view window: Windows / Rendering Editors / Render View

## Render settings
- Render Settings: Windows / Rendering Editors / Render Settings
	
### Common and specific renderer settings
- Common: attributes for all renderers include file name, image format, camera choices, image size and so on.

- Specific: attributes for a specific renderer

Example: Maya render specific attributes

## Cameras in Maya.
>*As with all filmmaking, the story is told through the camera.*

Although the technical aspects of using the cameras are not difficult to learn, mastering the art of virtual cinematography can take years of practice.

## Camera properties:

### Two aspect ratios: camera and film (rendering)

## Batch rendering
A batch file is a set of commands given to the computer to do, one after another. Using batch files, you can queue several rendering tasks at the same time, so that once one is finished, the next begins. Batch rendering often occurs as a different thread or process, as if it were a different program running in the background, so Maya allows you to keep working while the batch is rendering. 

Note that if you want to use Arnold batch rendering without watermarks in Maya, you need to purchase an Arnold license. Or alternatively you can render a sequence in Maya with the Render > Render Sequence command in the Render setting window; however you will not be able to use Maya while it is rendering.
